=========================================
Want a list of books and their authors.

books may have multiple authors.

Console App Model might want book + list of authors

Db.AuthorBookId has the IDs of books and authors - books with n authors have n entries.

Db.BookTitleAuthorName - does this need to match that? Depends on the query



Might want it to have one entry per book, with a list of authors

I think we do a Model (not a DbModel) of BookTitleAuthorNames
With title and List<authornames>
Maybe also with number of copies

Populate this by:
Q: Get a list of books grouped by ISBN (need to populate this field), count number in each group - this should give a list of books and count the copies.
For each of those books, populate a BookTitleAuthorNames object (use constructor)
	Q look in AuthorBook to get all the authorsIDs for each book.
	Q Authors to get author names
	Q Books to get Title (might be able to combine some of these steps)

This is a C#y class rather than a Db class. Put the methods for populating it in hte BookTitleAuthorNames class? Is this going to be a constructor?

(Console App might want author + list of books - but this is for another query)

==================================
May want to move the query bits to a client directory
